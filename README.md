# Classification-of-ASL-alphabets-using-deep-learning-models
Day to day communication can be very challenging for people belonging to deaf communities. 
They heavily rely on ASL or American Sign Language to communicate but this language is not understood by most people.
Machine learning can be used to solve this problem as classifying objects through images by using machine learning models 
has already been demonstrated in a lot of studies. In this project, 
we have explored different convolutional neural networks with varying pre-processing methods 
to classify ASL images into correct letters.
